# ACONEWS News Dashboard

A modern, responsive ACONEWS News Dashboard built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, fetching the latest headlines from the GNews API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* You have a GNews API key. If not, you can get one [here](https://gnews.io/)

## Installing ACONEWS News Dashboard

To install ACONEWS News Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tejasg910/new-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd news-dashboard
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuring the Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_GNEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_API_ENDPOINT=https://gnews.io/api/v4/top-headlines
   ```
   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual GNews API key.

## Running ACONEWS News Dashboard

To run ACONEWS News Dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

The page will reload if you make edits to the source files. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This command builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
